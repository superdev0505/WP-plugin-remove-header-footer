== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What post types can I use this plugin on? =



The free plugin works with pages only. The premium version works with all custom post types, including woocommerce.



= The plugin doesn´t work as expected? =



In that case our algorithm wasn´t able to find in your theme the header, footer, sidebars, or content element.  So you need to use the advanced settings and enter the elements css selector.

If you think this plugin is not working as intended, please contact us so we can help.
